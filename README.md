### Layout Aware Graph-based Entity Recognition model
A framework for document image understanding that extends layout-aware pre-trained language models such as LayoutLMv2/v3 and leverages the topological adjacency relationship of the tokens in the document using graph neural networks. This approach is robust to image manipulations such as shifting, rotating or scaling the document images.
